This document will serve as a concise tutorial in setting up a Scientific Linux network booting environment for the purpose of executing pxebooting on Scientific Flight computer for the ISS-CREAM (International Space Station - Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass) Project

NOTE
-We assume your host server uses Scientific Linux (or compatible subset of RedHat distribution)
-We assume that your host server and your client computer are connected through host-only network or through Ethernet

STEPS
1. Install DHCP, TFTP, and NFS in your host server by entering a simple command on terminal "yum install dhcp tftp nfs" on your host server
2. Change your directory to /etc folder and replace your current dhcpd.conf file with the one inside this package
3. Display the new (one we provide) dhcpd.conf file and follow the commented instruction to configure your DHCP server settings so that it would point to your pxelinux.0 file (which we will soon set up)
4. Enable the TFTP server by modifying your "/etc/xinetd.d/tftp" file (set "disable=no" and "server_args=/tftpboot -s")
5. Copy the "tftpboot" and "master" folder in this kit to your root directory
6. Modify the "/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default" file so that NFS can point to the correct server. To do this, set "nfsroot" parameter to your ip address followedby the "/master/diskless/sl5/i386/cd" (there is an example written on the "default" file)
7. Finally start portmapper and nfs by running the "start" file in this package
8. Boot your client machine (SFC) and when you reach a Scientific Linux boot screen, type "sl5diskless" and press enter to complete the network booting process

TROUBLESHOOTING
- If for some reason the SFC cannot network boot, it might be that your server's firewall is blocking external connection by default. To allow SFC to network boot, type the command "iptables -F" (flushes your settings)
